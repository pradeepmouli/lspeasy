# Release Workflow with Changesets
#
# This workflow uses Changesets to automate versioning and publishing to npm.
# It supports both traditional token-based auth and npm Trusted Publishers (OIDC).
#
# How it works:
# 1. When you push to master, Changesets creates a "Version Packages" PR
# 2. When that PR is merged, packages are automatically published to npm
# 3. GitHub releases are created automatically
#
# Publishing Authentication (Choose ONE):
#
# OPTION 1: Token-Based Publishing
#    - Create a token at: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/YOUR_USERNAME/tokens
#    - Use "Automation" token type with "Read and write" permission
#    - Add as repository secret: NPM_TOKEN
#    - Simpler setup, but less secure (long-lived token)
#
# OPTION 2: OIDC Trusted Publishing (Recommended)
#    - More secure: no tokens, uses short-lived credentials
#    - Requires configuration on npmjs.com for each package
#    - Go to: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/YOUR_USERNAME/packages/PACKAGE_NAME/access
#    - Enable "Trusted Publishers" under Publishing Access
#    - Add GitHub Actions as a trusted publisher:
#      * Provider: GitHub Actions
#      * Repository: pradeepmouli/lspeasy
#      * Workflow: release.yml
#      * Environment: (leave empty)
#    - CRITICAL: Remove NPM_TOKEN secret if it exists (NPM_TOKEN takes precedence)
#
# Note: If NPM_TOKEN secret is set, it will be used instead of OIDC.

      # ⚠️ AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED ⚠️
      #
      # This step requires authentication to publish to npm. Choose ONE option:
      #
      # OPTION 1: Token-Based Publishing
      #   - Create NPM token: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/YOUR_USERNAME/tokens
      #   - Add as repository secret: Settings > Secrets > Actions > NPM_TOKEN
      #   - Simpler but less secure (long-lived token)
      #
      # OPTION 2: OIDC Trusted Publishing (Recommended)
      #   - Configure trusted publisher: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/YOUR_USERNAME/packages/PACKAGE_NAME/access
      #   - Provider: GitHub Actions
      #   - Repository: pradeepmouli/lspeasy  
      #   - Workflow: release.yml
      #   - Environment: (leave empty)
      #   - CRITICAL: Remove NPM_TOKEN secret (even invalid tokens block OIDC!)
      #
      # Note: NPM_TOKEN takes precedence over OIDC if both are configured
