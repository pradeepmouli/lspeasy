# Release Workflow with Changesets
#
# This workflow uses Changesets to automate versioning and publishing to npm.
# It uses npm Trusted Publishers (OIDC) for secure, token-free publishing.
#
# How it works:
# 1. When you push to master, Changesets creates a "Version Packages" PR
# 2. When that PR is merged, packages are automatically published to npm
# 3. GitHub releases are created automatically
#
# Setup Instructions for npm Trusted Publishers (OIDC):
# 1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/settings/{your-username}/packages/{package-name}/access
# 2. Enable "Trusted Publishers" under Publishing Access
# 3. Add GitHub Actions as a trusted publisher:
#    - Provider: GitHub Actions
#    - Repository: your-org/your-repo
#    - Workflow: release.yml
#    - Environment: (leave empty or set to match environment in job)
#
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT set registry-url in actions/setup-node as it creates NODE_AUTH_TOKEN
# which overrides OIDC authentication. The changesets action handles this correctly.
